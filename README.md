# Parallel-and-concurrent-programming-Game-Project

Cambiecolo is a card game with the goal of presenting a hand of 5 cards of the same transport means , we have five types of transport :airplane, car, train, bike and shoes. The player who succeeds is awarded the points of the transport they put together.

To implement a multi-process model of the Cambiecolo game and to better visualize the concurrency and the parallelism that we saw in the PPC course .
The game will be in the form of one player interacting with the machine and the other players are going to be bots and in our case “processes”.

Find more detail in the pdf document that includes the architecture of the implementation. 

This game acts as a distributed system : nodes interacting between them and assuring a shared memory to rush into a convergence state which is having all the same cards. 

Technologies used : Mutex, Semaphores, Messages queues, Shared memory, Multi-processing, Multi-threading,  Signales...
